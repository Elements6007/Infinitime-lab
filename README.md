# PineTime

![Build PineTime Firmware](https://github.com/joaquimorg/Pinetime/workflows/Build%20PineTime%20Firmware/badge.svg)

> The PineTime is a free and open source smartwatch capable of running custom-built open operating systems. Some of the notable features include a heart rate monitor, a week-long battery as well as a capacitive touch IPS display that is legible in direct sunlight. It is a fully community driven side-project, which means that it will ultimately be up to the developers and end-users to determine when they deem the PineTime ready to ship.

> We envision the PineTime as a companion for not only your PinePhone but also for your favorite devices â€” any phone, tablet, or even PC.

The **Pinetime** smartwatch is built around the NRF52832 MCU (512KB Flash, 64KB RAM), a 240*240 LCD display driven by the ST7789 controller, an accelerometer, a heart rate sensor, and a vibration motor.

# PinetimeLite

This project is a fork of [Infinitime](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime)

The purpose of **PinetimeLite** is to build firmware for Pinetime that is lightweight and maximizes battery life.
The functionalities to be implemented are:
- Clock, with the possibility of having several faces.
- Notifications, both from applications such as SMS, Whatsapp, etc ... as well as calls.
- Step count

All other features available on the Pinetime hardware will not be supported.
